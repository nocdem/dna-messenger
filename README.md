# DNA Messenger

**Post-quantum encrypted messaging platform**

Secure messaging using post-quantum cryptography (Kyber512 + Dilithium3) that remains secure against future quantum computer attacks.

## Status

üöß **Alpha Development**

**Version:** 0.1.x (x = git commit count)
- **Major:** 0 (Alpha - breaking changes expected)
- **Minor:** 1 (Current feature set)
- **Patch:** Auto-incremented with each commit

**Available in two versions:**
- **GUI:** Qt5 graphical interface with theme support and auto-updates
- **CLI:** Command-line interface for terminal users

## Quick Start

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Pre-built binaries available via GitLab CI/CD artifacts (see below)
- Build instructions may be slightly outdated - we iterate rapidly
- **Windows builds are complex** and may take significant time to set up for local development

### Pre-Built Binaries

Binaries from the latest builds are available on GitLab CI/CD artifacts:
- **Download:** https://gitlab.cpunk.io/cpunk/dna-messenger/-/artifacts

Available platforms:
- **Linux x86_64:** CLI and GUI binaries
- **Linux ARM64:** CLI and GUI binaries
- **Windows x64:** CLI and GUI executables (statically linked)

Note: Builds are generated on every push to main branch.

### Automated Installation Scripts (Recommended)

**For Linux (Easy - One Command):**
```bash
# Download and run the install script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocdem/dna-messenger/main/install.sh | bash

# Or if already cloned:
cd dna-messenger
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script will:
- Auto-detect your Linux distribution (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch)
- Install all required dependencies
- Clone or update the repository
- Build from scratch
- Show you where the binaries are located

**For Windows (Cross-Compilation from Linux):**

Windows builds are now created via cross-compilation using MXE (M cross environment).

Prerequisites (Linux system):
- MXE cross-compilation environment

```bash
# Install or clone MXE (one time setup - takes 1-2 hours)
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git ~/.cache/mxe
# Or install to /opt/buildtools/mxe

# Build for Windows
./build-cross-compile.sh windows-x64

# Binaries will be in dist/windows-x64/
```

‚è±Ô∏è **First run may take 1-2 hours** for MXE dependency compilation

### Linux (Manual Build from Source)

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install cmake gcc libssl-dev libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev

# Build
git clone https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger.git
cd dna-messenger
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run GUI
./gui/dna_messenger_gui

# Or run CLI
./dna_messenger
```

### Windows (Cross-Compilation from Linux)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Windows builds are now cross-compiled from Linux using MXE.**
Native Windows builds with vcpkg are no longer supported.

**Prerequisites:**
- Linux build environment (native or WSL2)
- MXE (M cross environment) installed

**Build Steps:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger.git
cd dna-messenger

# Set MXE directory (if not in default location)
export MXE_DIR=/path/to/mxe  # e.g., /opt/buildtools/mxe or ~/.cache/mxe

# Build for Windows
./build-cross-compile.sh windows-x64

# Output:
# - dist/dna-messenger-VERSION-windows-x64.zip
# - build-release/windows-x64/dna_messenger.exe (CLI)
# - build-release/windows-x64/gui/dna_messenger_gui.exe (GUI)
```

**MXE Setup (First Time Only):**
```bash
# Clone MXE
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git ~/.cache/mxe
cd ~/.cache/mxe

# Build dependencies (takes 1-2 hours on first run)
make MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static qtbase qtmultimedia postgresql openssl json-c curl -j$(nproc)
```

**Tip:** Wait for official Windows installer releases if you're not comfortable with cross-compilation.

- Multi-device sync via DHT
- SQLite encrypted with DNA's PQ crypto (Kyber512 + AES-256-GCM)
- Zero-knowledge storage (nodes cannot read messages)

**See `/futuredesign/` folder for complete architecture specifications**

**For detailed roadmap, see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**

## Architecture

**Current (Phase 4):**
- Client application (GUI, CLI, or Web)
- PostgreSQL message storage (ai.cpunk.io:5432)
- Centralized keyserver API for public key distribution
- Your private keys stay on your device (`~/.dna/`)

**Security:**
- Messages encrypted on your device before sending
- Only recipient can decrypt (end-to-end encryption)
- Post-quantum algorithms (Kyber512 + Dilithium3)
- Cryptographically signed messages (tamper-proof)
- Future: P2P transport with libp2p (encrypted multiplexing)

## Cryptography

- **Key Encapsulation:** Kyber512 (NIST PQC Level 1)
- **Signatures:** Dilithium3 (ML-DSA-65, FIPS 204)
- **Symmetric:** AES-256-GCM (AEAD)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512

## Recovery

**Backup Your Keys:**
1. Write down your 24-word recovery phrase during identity creation
2. Store it safely offline (never digitally)
3. Optional: Add passphrase for extra security

**Restore Your Keys:**
1. Choose "Restore from seed phrase" at startup
2. Enter your 24 words
3. Keys regenerated and verified against keyserver

### About cpunk

cpunk is the **world's first meme coin** on the Cellframe Network. DNA Messenger now includes a full cpunk wallet integration (Phase 8 complete), enabling payment operations directly within the app. Users can view balances, send/receive CPUNK, CELL, and KEL tokens for services, tips, and peer-to-peer transactions on the Cellframe Backbone network.
