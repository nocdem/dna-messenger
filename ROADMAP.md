## Phase 10: DNA Board - Censorship-Resistant Social Media 📋 PLANNED

**Timeline:** 12 weeks
**Status:** Planning (Post-Phases 7-9)
**Prerequisites:** Distributed validator storage, DNA-Keyserver merge, Offline messaging system
**Design Document:** `/DNA_BOARD_PHASE10_PLAN.md`

### Overview

DNA Board is a **censorship-resistant social media platform** built on cpunk validator network. Content cannot be removed once posted, creating a true free speech platform with built-in spam protection.

**Core Principles:**
1. **NO CENSORSHIP** - Content cannot be removed (no deletion endpoint)
2. **PoH Required to Post** - Only human-verified users (PoH ≥70) can create posts
3. **Open Responses** - Anyone can reply/comment (no PoH requirement for replies)
4. **Community Voting** - Thumbs up/down to surface quality content
5. **Burn Economics** - All storage fees permanently burned (deflationary)
6. **Validator Rewards** - DAO pool distribution (no payment from users)

### Architecture

```
Self-Healing Validator Network (3-Replica)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Post → Primary Validator                   │
│    ↓                                         │
│  Replicate to 2 more (lowest storage)       │
│    ↓                                         │
│  3 Validators store content                 │
│    ↓                                         │
│  Heartbeat monitoring (30s intervals)       │
│    ↓                                         │
│  If validator offline → Auto-heal           │
│    ↓                                         │
│  Re-replicate to new validator              │
│    ↓                                         │
│  Back to 3 replicas (maintained)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Content & Economics

| Type | Burn Fee | PoH Required | Max Size | Replication |
|------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Text Post | 1 CPUNK | Yes (≥70) | 5,000 chars | 3 validators |
| Image | 2 CPUNK | Yes (with post) | 5 MB | 3 validators |
| Video | 5 CPUNK | Yes (with post) | 50 MB | 3 validators |
| Reply | 0.5 CPUNK | **No** | 2,000 chars | 3 validators |
| Vote | **FREE** | No | N/A | Aggregated |

**All fees BURNED** → Deflationary pressure (estimated 16M CPUNK/year burned)

### Proof of Humanity (PoH) System

**Who Can Post:** Only verified humans with `humanity_score >= 70`

**Verification Tiers:**
- **Auto-Verified** (75-89): Behavioral algorithm (most users)
- **Staked-Verified** (90-94): Auto + 100 CPUNK stake
- **DAO-Vouched** (95-99): 3 human vouches + DAO review
- **Celebrity** (100): Public figure + DAO verification

**Bot Detection:** Single-destination sends, mechanical timing, no staking
**Human Patterns:** Multiple services, irregular timing, social verification, staking

### Who Can Respond

**ANYONE can reply** to existing posts:
- No PoH requirement for replies
- Still requires 0.5 CPUNK burn (prevents pure spam)
- Enables free discussion and debate
- Bot responses downvoted by community

**Balance:** Spam prevention at post level + free speech at reply level

### Implementation Phases

#### Weeks 5-6: Voting System
- [ ] Create vote storage and aggregation
- [ ] Build `/dna_board/vote` endpoint

- [ ] Community beta testing (100+ users)
- [ ] Security audit (signatures, burn verification)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] DAO vote on Year 1 pool (100M CPUNK)
- [ ] Mainnet launch

### Key Features

**Censorship Resistance:**
- ✅ No deletion endpoint (content permanent)
- ✅ 3-validator replication across jurisdictions
- ✅ No central authority or single point of control
- ✅ Client-side blocking only (no server-side)
- ✅ Gossip protocol ensures propagation

**Quality Control:**
- ✅ PoH requirement prevents bot spam
- ✅ Community voting surfaces quality content
- ✅ Ranking algorithm (votes × humanity × time × engagement)
- ✅ Multiple feed views (Ranked, Recent, Top, Controversial)

**Economic Model:**
- ✅ All fees burned (deflationary)
- ✅ Validator rewards from DAO pool (100M Year 1, halvening)
- ✅ Stake + storage formula for validator rewards
- ✅ No payment from users to validators

### Deliverables

- Fully censorship-resistant social media platform
- 3-validator self-healing replication
- PoH verification system (behavioral + staking)
- Qt GUI integration (DNABoardTab)
- Burn economics (CPUNK deflationary pressure)
- DAO-governed validator rewards

## Phase 11: Post-Quantum Voice/Video Calls 📋 PLANNED

**Timeline:** ~20 weeks (5 months)
**Status:** Research & Planning
**Prerequisites:** Phase 9.1 (P2P Transport Layer)
**Design Document:** `/futuredesign/VOICE-VIDEO-DESIGN.md`

### Overview

Fully **quantum-safe voice and video calls** using custom architecture that bypasses WebRTC's quantum-vulnerable DTLS handshake.

**Key Innovation:** Kyber512 key exchange via DNA messaging + standard SRTP media = Post-quantum calls today

### Architecture

```
Signaling (DNA Messaging) → NAT Traversal (libnice) → Media (SRTP + AES-256-GCM)
    ↓                           ↓                         ↓
Kyber512 + Dilithium3     ICE/STUN/TURN           Opus audio / VP8 video
```

### Key Features

**Quantum-Resistant Security:**
- Kyber512 (NIST FIPS 203) for key exchange
- Dilithium3 (NIST FIPS 204) for signatures
- AES-256-GCM for media encryption
- Forward secrecy (ephemeral keys per call)
- SAS verification for MITM protection

**Technology Stack:**
- **libnice** - ICE/STUN/TURN (NAT traversal)
- **libsrtp2** - Secure RTP with AES-256-GCM
- **libopus** - Audio codec (48kHz stereo)
- **libvpx/libx264** - Video codec (VP8 or H.264)
- **PortAudio** - Microphone/speaker I/O
- **V4L2/DirectShow** - Camera capture

### Why This is Better

1. **Full Quantum Resistance** - No quantum-vulnerable components
2. **Uses Existing Crypto** - Same Kyber/Dilithium as messaging
3. **Independent of Standards** - Don't wait for WebRTC PQ support (3-5 years away)
4. **Better Privacy** - Signaling through DNA's E2E encrypted channel
5. **Forward Secrecy** - Ephemeral keys per call
6. **Available Today** - Can deploy immediately (desktop/mobile)

### Implementation Sub-Phases

- **Weeks 1-4:** Signaling via DNA messaging
- **Weeks 5-8:** NAT traversal (libnice integration)
- **Weeks 9-12:** Audio calls (Opus + PortAudio + SRTP)
- **Weeks 13-16:** Video calls (VP8/H.264 + camera)
- **Weeks 17-20:** Polish & testing

### Future Enhancements

- Group calls (mesh topology, 8 participants)
- Screen sharing (H.264 high-profile)
- Call recording (local only, preserves E2E)
- SFU for large conferences (100+ participants)
