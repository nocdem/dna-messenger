# DNA Messenger

**Post-quantum encrypted messaging platform**

Secure messaging using post-quantum cryptography (Kyber512 + Dilithium3) that remains secure against future quantum computer attacks.

## Status

üöß **Alpha Development**

**Version:** 0.1.x (x = git commit count)
- **Major:** 0 (Alpha - breaking changes expected)
- **Minor:** 1 (Current feature set)
- **Patch:** Auto-incremented with each commit

**Available in two versions:**
- **GUI:** Qt5 graphical interface with theme support and auto-updates
- **CLI:** Command-line interface for terminal users

## Quick Start

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- We are **NOT releasing pre-built binaries** during alpha development (building ~20 times/day)
- Build instructions below may be slightly outdated - we iterate rapidly
- **Windows builds are complex** and may take significant time to set up

### Pre-Built Installers (When Available)

When we release stable binaries, they will be available here:
- **Linux:** https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger/releases (AppImage/deb)
- **Windows:** https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger/releases (installer.exe)

Currently, you must build from source.

### Automated Installation Scripts (Recommended)

**For Linux (Easy - One Command):**
```bash
# Download and run the install script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nocdem/dna-messenger/main/install.sh | bash

# Or if already cloned:
cd dna-messenger
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script will:
- Auto-detect your Linux distribution (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch)
- Install all required dependencies
- Clone or update the repository
- Build from scratch
- Show you where the binaries are located

**For Windows (Requires Prerequisites):**

Prerequisites (install these first):
- Git for Windows
- CMake
- vcpkg (package manager)
- Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ tools

```cmd
REM Clone repository to C:\dna-messenger first
cd C:\dna-messenger
install_windows.bat
```

The `install_windows.bat` script will:
- Check for required tools (git, cmake, vcpkg)
- Install dependencies via vcpkg (OpenSSL, PostgreSQL, Qt5, etc.)
- Pull latest code
- Build from scratch
- ‚è±Ô∏è **First run may take 30-60 minutes** for dependency installation

### Linux (Manual Build from Source)

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install cmake gcc libssl-dev libpq-dev qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev

# Build
git clone https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger.git
cd dna-messenger
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run GUI
./gui/dna_messenger_gui

# Or run CLI
./dna_messenger
```

### Windows (Manual Build from Source)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Windows Warning:** First-time setup may take **up to 1 hour** to install dependencies.
Building on Windows is currently difficult and not recommended for casual users.
**Use the automated `install_windows.bat` script above instead.**

```cmd
REM Install dependencies first (Qt5, PostgreSQL, OpenSSL, CMake, Visual Studio)
REM This can take 30-60 minutes on first setup

git clone https://github.com/nocdem/dna-messenger.git
cd dna-messenger
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release

REM Run GUI
gui\Release\dna_messenger_gui.exe

REM Or run CLI
Release\dna_messenger.exe
```

**Tip:** Wait for official Windows installer releases if you're not comfortable with build tools.

**See `/futuredesign/` folder for complete architecture specifications**

**For detailed roadmap, see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**

## Architecture

**Current (Phase 4):**
- Client application (GUI, CLI, or Web)
- PostgreSQL message storage (ai.cpunk.io:5432)
- Centralized keyserver API for public key distribution
- Your private keys stay on your device (`~/.dna/`)

**Security:**
- Messages encrypted on your device before sending
- Only recipient can decrypt (end-to-end encryption)
- Post-quantum algorithms (Kyber512 + Dilithium3)
- Cryptographically signed messages (tamper-proof)
- Future: P2P transport with libp2p (encrypted multiplexing)

## Cryptography

- **Key Encapsulation:** Kyber512 (NIST PQC Level 1)
- **Signatures:** Dilithium3 (ML-DSA-65, FIPS 204)
- **Symmetric:** AES-256-GCM (AEAD)
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512

## Recovery

**Backup Your Keys:**
1. Write down your 24-word recovery phrase during identity creation
2. Store it safely offline (never digitally)
3. Optional: Add passphrase for extra security

**Restore Your Keys:**
1. Choose "Restore from seed phrase" at startup
2. Enter your 24 words
3. Keys regenerated and verified against keyserver

### About cpunk

cpunk is the **world's first meme coin** on the Cellframe Network. CF20 wallet integration (Phase 8+) will enable payment operations directly within DNA Messenger, allowing users to send/receive cpunk tokens for services, tips, and peer-to-peer transactions on the cpunk network.
